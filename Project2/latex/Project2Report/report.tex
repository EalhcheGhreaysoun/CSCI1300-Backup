    CSCI 1300 Project 2 Final Report
\end{center}

Preperation for this project was minimal and consisted mostly of review of concepts, topics, and syntax of relevent packages and data types. In addition to this, review of project requirements and provided files.

Developement of the code skeleton involved understanding the prexisting code structure and the necessary additions in order to facilitate the game functionality. Spesifically, classes and functionality for players as well as getter and setter function to access board and player member values.

Execution and implementation of game functionality and code skeleton could have been sped along by a better understanding of prexisting code structure as well as a clearer idea of desired final code structure. An example of this is how the player class has a member variable of class board. If the project were to be redone, a member of type player would be in class board.

Not many issues or false starts occured.
